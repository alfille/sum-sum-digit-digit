## The problem:
Imagine the number:
9+
99+
999+
...
99...9 (321 nines)

What is the sum of the digits of this rather big number?

## Trials:

 1. 9 -> 9
 2. 9+99=108 ->9
 3. 9+99+999=1007 ->9 
 4. hmmm... but it breaks  
    down after 9 9's.

## Method:

 Well, that would give it away. Look at the [wiki](https://github.com/alfille/sum-sum-digit-digit/wiki) where the  problem, the solution, and the far more general analysis is shown.
